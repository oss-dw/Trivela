**Trivela** is a Stellar Soroban–based **campaign and rewards platform**. It lets campaign operators create on-chain campaigns, register participants, award points via smart contracts, and let users claim rewards—all on the Stellar network. The project is built for the [Stellar Wave on Drips](https://www.drips.network/wave/stellar) and is designed for open-source contributors.

## What Trivela Does?

- **Campaigns** – Create and manage reward campaigns with on-chain configuration (Soroban).
- **Rewards contract** – Tracks user points, credits (by admin/campaign), and claims.
- **Campaign contract** – Stores campaign active flag and participant registration.
- **Backend API** – REST API for campaign metadata, health checks, and integration.
- **Frontend** – React app to list campaigns and (when wired) connect wallets and interact with contracts.

Use cases: loyalty points, drip campaigns, bounties, and any flow where you need **on-chain rewards + off-chain campaign metadata**.

## Architecture

For a quick system map (diagram, trust boundaries, and end-to-end data flows), see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md).
For the supported Stellar testnet/mainnet presets and runtime config flow, see [`docs/STELLAR_NETWORKS.md`](docs/STELLAR_NETWORKS.md).

## Security & rate limiting

All public `/api/*` and `/api/v1/*` routes are protected by a rate
limiter that keys per **API key** when present and falls back to
per-IP otherwise. Standard `X-RateLimit-Limit` / `-Remaining` / `-Reset`
headers are emitted on every response; the limiter returns
`429 Too Many Requests` + `Retry-After` once the bucket is exhausted.

Configuration via env (defaults below; see [`backend/.env.example`](./backend/.env.example)):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS` | `60000` | Window size in milliseconds |
| `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | `60` | Max requests per key per window |
| `REDIS_HOST` / `REDIS_URL` | _(unset)_ | When set, swaps the in-memory bucket store for Redis so multiple API pods share state |

Full implementation details (header schema, 429 payload shape,
Redis-store considerations) live in [`backend/README.md`](./backend/README.md).
Middleware source is `backend/src/middleware/rateLimit.js`; unit tests are
in `backend/src/middleware/rateLimit.test.js`.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (for Soroban): [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Stellar CLI** (optional but recommended): [Install Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup#install-the-stellar-cli)
- **Node.js** 18+

---

## Git setup (maintainers)

If you cloned or created this repo without git:

```bash
./scripts/setup-git.sh
git add . && git commit -m "chore: initial Trivela scaffold"
git branch -M main && git push -u origin main
```

Use a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope when pushing over HTTPS, or switch to SSH: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:FinesseStudioLab/Trivela.git`.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FinesseStudioLab/Trivela.git
cd Trivela
npm install
```

### Monorepo task runner (Turborepo)

The repo uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to coordinate builds and
tests across the `backend` and `frontend` workspaces with caching and
parallelization. Prefer these root-level commands over running each workspace
by hand:

```bash
npm run build   # build:contracts (cargo/stellar), then turbo run build (frontend)
npm run test    # turbo run test  (backend + frontend in parallel)
npm run lint    # turbo run lint  (all workspaces in parallel)
npm run dev      # turbo run dev   (backend + frontend concurrently)
```

`npm run build` builds the Soroban contracts first (which produces the
TypeScript bindings the frontend depends on) and then runs `turbo run build`.
Turbo caches task outputs, so unchanged workspaces are skipped on subsequent
runs.

**Remote cache (optional):** remote caching is enabled in `turbo.json`. To share
the cache across CI and machines, export a Vercel Remote Cache (or self-hosted)
token:

```bash
export TURBO_TOKEN=<your-token>
export TURBO_TEAM=<your-team>
```

Without these variables Turbo falls back to the local `.turbo` cache only.

### 2. Build and run contracts (Soroban)

To build the smart contracts, ensure you have the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup#install-the-stellar-cli) installed.

```bash
# Build both contracts using Stellar CLI
stellar contract build

# Alternatively, build specific packages with cargo
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p trivela-rewards-contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release -p trivela-campaign-contract
```

#### Building and deploying contracts

Required environment for deploy commands:

```bash
export STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
export STELLAR_SOURCE=alice
```

`STELLAR_NETWORK` is your Stellar CLI network alias (for example `testnet` or `mainnet`), and `STELLAR_SOURCE` is the Stellar CLI identity to sign deploy transactions.

Build commands:

```bash
stellar contract build
```

Deploy commands:

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/trivela_rewards_contract.wasm \
  --source "$STELLAR_SOURCE" \
  --network "$STELLAR_NETWORK"

stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/trivela_campaign_contract.wasm \
  --source "$STELLAR_SOURCE" \
  --network "$STELLAR_NETWORK"
```

#### Deploying to Testnet

1. **Configure an Identity**:
   ```bash
   stellar keys generate alice --network testnet
   ```

2. **Deploy the WASM**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy Rewards Contract
   stellar contract deploy \
     --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/trivela_rewards_contract.wasm \
     --source alice --network testnet

   # Deploy Campaign Contract
   stellar contract deploy \
     --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/trivela_campaign_contract.wasm \
     --source alice --network testnet
   ```

3. **Initialize the Contracts**:
   After deployment, you will receive a Contract ID. Use it to call the `initialize` function:
   ```bash
   stellar contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> --source alice --network testnet -- \
     initialize --admin alice --name "Trivela Rewards" --symbol "TVL"
   ```

#### One-command testnet deploy

You can also build and deploy both contracts with the helper script:

```bash
STELLAR_SOURCE=alice npm run deploy:testnet
```

Optional environment variables:

- `STELLAR_NETWORK`: Stellar CLI network alias to deploy against (defaults to `testnet`)
- `STELLAR_SOURCE`: Stellar CLI identity used for the deploy
- `TRIVELA_ENV_OUT`: output env file for the deployed contract IDs (defaults to `.env.testnet`)

The script writes:

```bash
VITE_REWARDS_CONTRACT_ID=...
VITE_CAMPAIGN_CONTRACT_ID=...
```


### 3. Run backend

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
npm run dev:backend
```

API: http://localhost:3001 (health: http://localhost:3001/health, v1: http://localhost:3001/api/v1).

Campaign endpoints are available under the versioned prefix:

```bash
GET    /api/v1/campaigns
GET    /api/v1/campaigns/:id
POST   /api/v1/campaigns
PUT    /api/v1/campaigns/:id
DELETE /api/v1/campaigns/:id
```

Migration note:
Legacy `/api/*` campaign routes are still available for backward compatibility, but new integrations should target `/api/v1/*`.

### 4. Run frontend

```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

App: http://localhost:5173 (proxies `/api` and `/api/v1` to the backend).

### 5. Run both services with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts the backend on `http://localhost:3001` and the frontend on `http://localhost:5173`.
The backend container uses `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173` and the frontend container
uses `VITE_API_URL=http://backend:3001` so the two services can talk to each other on the Compose
network.

To add the optional Redis service for local experimentation, include the `redis` profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile redis up --build
```

---

## Testing

```bash
# Backend + Frontend tests via Turborepo (parallel, cached)
npm run test

# Rust contracts (run independently of the Turbo pipeline)
cargo test --workspace
npm run test:contracts

# Backend tests
npm run test:backend

# Frontend E2E tests (Playwright)
# 1. Build the frontend first (required for `npm run preview`)
npm run build:frontend
# 2. Run the tests
npm run test:frontend
```

The frontend E2E tests use **Playwright**. They run against a local preview server (`npm run preview`). Ensure the backend is running if you want the tests to hit real API endpoints, otherwise they will show the "empty state" as expected in a isolated environment.

## Maintainer automation

Sync the shared label taxonomy with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh auth login
npm run labels:sync -- --repo FinesseStudioLab/Trivela
```

The taxonomy lives in [`scripts/github-labels.json`](scripts/github-labels.json) and the sync script is idempotent, so re-running it updates colors/descriptions instead of failing.

## Creating the 50 contributor issues (maintainers)

After the repo is pushed, create labels and open all 50 issues in GitHub in one go:

```bash
node scripts/create-github-issues.js
```

This reads `PAT` from `.env.local`, creates issues from `docs/issues-data.json`, and can still be used for bulk issue creation. For labels, prefer `npm run labels:sync` so maintainers can rely on `gh auth` instead of PAT-based automation.
