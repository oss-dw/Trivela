# ADR-004: Freighter as the primary wallet integration

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-12-01

## Context

The Trivela frontend needs a way for users to sign Soroban transactions from the browser. Options
considered: Freighter browser extension, WalletConnect (Stellar variant), xBull Wallet, LOBSTR,
hardware wallet (Ledger via Stellar SDK), or bringing our own key management (custodial).

## Decision

Integrate **Freighter** as the first-class, primary wallet via `@stellar/freighter-api`.

## Reasons

1. **Stellar Wave alignment** — Freighter is the SDF-maintained reference wallet for Soroban dApps
   and is the integration example in all Soroban developer guides.
2. **`@stellar/freighter-api`** — provides a typed, promise-based API: `isConnected()`,
   `getPublicKey()`, `signTransaction()`. No custom transaction serialization needed beyond the
   standard SDK XDR.
3. **Soroban-native** — Freighter correctly handles Soroban footprint simulation, resource fees, and
   the `AUTH_REQUIRED` flag; generic WalletConnect adapters lagged behind on Soroban support at the
   time of this decision.
4. **User familiarity** — Stellar/Soroban users already have Freighter installed for other dApps;
   reducing setup friction increases conversion.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** Fastest path to a working sign-and-submit flow in the browser.
- **Positive:** SDF keeps Freighter updated with new Soroban protocol versions; we get protocol
  upgrades "for free."
- **Negative:** Freighter is a browser extension; mobile users and users on locked-down environments
  cannot use it without additional wallet support.
- **Negative:** If a user does not have Freighter installed, the UI must detect
  `window.freighter === undefined` and show an install prompt — there is no in-app fallback key
  management.
- **Negative:** Only one wallet deep-linked; contributors wanting to add WalletConnect or xBull must
  implement a wallet-adapter abstraction layer first (see open issue for multi-wallet support).

## Future

Abstract wallet interactions behind a `WalletProvider` interface so Freighter, xBull, and
WalletConnect can be plugged in without changing call sites. Update this ADR when a second wallet is
formally supported.
