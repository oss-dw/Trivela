# Error Codes Reference

This document defines all error codes returned by Trivela smart contracts and provides
frontend-friendly message mappings.

## Frontend Error Mapping

Use this mapping to display user-friendly error messages:

```javascript
// Error code to user message mapping
const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  // Campaign contract errors
  100: "You don't have permission to perform this action",
  101: 'This campaign is not currently accepting registrations',
  102: 'This campaign has reached its participant limit',
  103: 'This campaign is not active',
  104: 'Your address is not eligible for this campaign',
  105: 'This action has already been processed or contract migration failed',

  // Rewards contract errors
  1: 'Balance calculation error. Please contact support',
  2: 'Insufficient balance to claim this amount',
  3: "You don't have permission to perform this action",
  4: 'The rewards contract is temporarily unavailable',
  5: 'Credit amount exceeds the maximum allowed per transaction',
  6: 'Invalid reward configuration. Please contact support',

  // HTTP status codes
  400: 'Invalid input. Please check your data and try again',
  401: 'API key is required or invalid',
  404: 'The requested resource was not found',
  429: 'Too many requests. Please wait before trying again',
  500: 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later',
  503: 'The blockchain service is temporarily unavailable',
};

// Usage in React component
function handleContractError(error) {
  const errorCode = error.code || error.status;
  const message = ERROR_MESSAGES[errorCode] || 'An error occurred';
  return message;
}
```

## Error Handling Best Practices

### Smart Contracts

1. **Always return specific error codes** – Use enum values, not generic errors
2. **Document error conditions** – Add comments explaining when each error occurs
3. **Validate early** – Check preconditions before state changes
4. **Atomic operations** – Ensure all-or-nothing semantics for multi-step operations

### Backend

1. **Validate input** – Return 400 with detailed error array
2. **Log errors** – Include error code and context for debugging
3. **Rate limit gracefully** – Return 429 with `Retry-After` header
4. **Health checks** – Return 503 when dependencies unavailable

### Frontend

1. **Catch and map errors** – Use `ERROR_MESSAGES` mapping
2. **Show context** – Display what action failed and why
3. **Provide recovery** – Suggest next steps (retry, contact support, etc.)
4. **Log for debugging** – Send error details to monitoring service

## Example: Handling a Registration Error

### Contract returns error code 104 (NotInAllowlist)

```javascript
// Frontend receives error from Soroban RPC
try {
  await registerInCampaign(address, proof);
} catch (error) {
  const message = ERROR_MESSAGES[104];
  // "Your address is not eligible for this campaign"
  showErrorToast(message);
  // Suggest: "Contact the campaign operator for eligibility"
}
```

### Contract returns error code 101 (OutsideTimeWindow)

```javascript
try {
  await registerInCampaign(address, proof);
} catch (error) {
  const message = ERROR_MESSAGES[101];
  // "This campaign is not currently accepting registrations"
  showErrorToast(message);
  // Suggest: "Check the campaign details for registration dates"
}
```

## Adding New Error Codes

When adding new error codes:

1. **Update contract enum** – Add to `Error` enum in contract
2. **Document in this file** – Add row to appropriate table
3. **Update frontend mapping** – Add entry to `ERROR_MESSAGES`
4. **Test error flow** – Verify frontend displays correct message
5. **Update CHANGELOG** – Note new error code in release notes
